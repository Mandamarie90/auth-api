# auth-api
**Author**: Amanda Mendoza
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This project aims to enhance our system's access control by implementing Role Based Access Control (RBAC) through an Access Control List (ACL). We plan to integrate an authentication server with an API server to form a unified, secure API server. The primary goal is to augment route restrictions within the API, ensuring only authorized users with appropriate permissions can access specific functionalities. Regular users will be able to read data, writers will read and create, editors will also update, and administrators will have full access to read, create, update, and delete. We will protect these API routes using both authentication and authorization based on users' permissions. This approach leverages advanced coding techniques to deliver a secure, fully functional API server, enhancing system security and control.

## Getting Started
To activate the server install dependencies and type node index.js or nodemon into your shell.

## Architecture
Node.js express dotenv PostgreSQL14 Basic-64 bcrypt
